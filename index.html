The immense emissions/release of gases such as C02, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, lead etc are some of the biggest contributors to not only overall pollution but also Climate Change. Global Warming also known as Climate Change is one of the greatest challenges that mankind has faced and needs to overcome as soon as possible.<br> <br>This Website not only aims to educate or spread awareness but to also, build an ethical bond, honesty, trust and interdependance between the population of this rare planet that we call Earth. We hope that everyone that goes through or even skims through our website is encouraged to conduct any small or big action to protect our Earth because "<u><b>THERE IS NO PLANET B</b></u>".</h3></i>
